I've been assigned to complete at least three tasks as a part of this AI Intership.
The tasks that I have executed are:
1. TicTacToe AI.
   Implement an AI agent that plays the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe
against a human player. You can use algorithms like Minimax with
or without Alpha-Beta Pruning to make the AI player unbeatable.
This project will help you understand game theory and basic search
algorithms.
2. Rule Based Chatbot.
   Build a simple chatbot that responds to user inputs based on
predefined rules. Use if-else statements or pattern matching
techniques to identify user queries and provide appropriate
responses. This will give you a basic understanding of natural
language processing and conversation flow.
3. Recommendation System.
   Create a simple recommendation system that suggests items to
users based on their preferences. You can use techniques like
collaborative filtering or content-based filtering to recommend
movies, books, or products to users.
In my repository, I have included the source code for all the three tasks mentioned above including the screen recording with the output as a proof of their successful execution.
The links to the datasets used are also mentioned.
